A former Post-16 Mathematics Teacher, Mathematics with Finance graduate, and alumnus of the Makers Fellowship Programme. I'm a full-stack software developer with experience building applications in Ruby, JavaScript and Python using test-driven development.

## Skills

#### Programming languages, frameworks and methodologies

- __Object oriented programming__ using Ruby, JavaScript, Python
- __Full stack web development__ using Rails, Sinatra, React, Node.js, PostgresSQL, Firebase
- __Test-driven development__ using Rspec, Capybara, Jasmine, Jest, Mocha, Enzyme
- __Data analysis and visualisation__ using R and Python
- __Continuous Integration & Deployment__ using TravisCI, CircleCI, Heroku and Firebase

#### Agile Practitioner

  While working as a Mathematics teacher, I experimented with using the eduScrum framework with an A-Level class and used a Kanban board to manage the GCSE course team. This resulted in improved outcomes for students and led to other teachers in the department adopting Scrum rituals.

  Working in Scrum teams whilst at Makers, I have helped my teams discover and follow Scrum rituals and improved collaborative processes by using tools such as Waffle with GitHub integration.

#### Coaching & Mentoring

  Since finishing the course at Makers I have supported other students in a role as an assistant coach. This involved performing code reviews for current students and

  As a Mathematics teacher I encouraged students to develop a growth mindset and helped prepare them for self led learning upon leaving college.

#### Quick Learner & Creative Problem Solver

  I am an inquisitive, life-long learner and am at my happiest when learning something new.

  My teaching career and Mathematics background has helped me develop a strong problem solving process which I have been able to successfully apply in my work as a software developer.

## Education

#### Makers (Sep 2018 to Jan 2019)

A 16-week intensive bootcamp focusing on:

- Object-oriented programming
- Test driven development and Behaviour driven development
- Agile methodologies
- XP values
- Pair programming

#### University of Brighton (Sep 2012 - Jun 2013)

PGCE Mathematics (Secondary)

## Interests

#### Cycling

I regularly cycle to work and enjoy completing long-distance journeys. I have taught myself to completely strip, service and rebuild bikes. While living in Brighton I volunteered at Cranks, a DIY workshop, helping people to learn fix and maintain their bikes.

#### Food

I love to cook and can be regularly found baking sourdough bread, brewing my own beer, or experimenting with precision sous-vide cooking.

### Music

At university, I taught myself music production which led to me working with a band and touring UK venues and festivals, as well as promoting gigs in Nottingham and Leeds.
